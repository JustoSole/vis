elonmusk	Thu Sep 20 18:52:52 +0000 2018	1140	64	@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.
elonmusk	Thu Sep 20 18:51:23 +0000 2018	1040	66	@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

elonmusk	Thu Sep 20 18:26:29 +0000 2018	1247	99	@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car.

elonmusk	Fri Jul 06 22:36:50 +0000 2018	1143	93	@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.

elonmusk	Fri Jul 06 21:42:09 +0000 2018	552	27	@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.

elonmusk	Fri Jul 06 07:36:44 +0000 2018	3841	681	@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
elonmusk	Fri Jul 06 06:13:44 +0000 2018	2102	239	@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.

elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 17:12:11 +0000 2018	623	58	@cfarivar There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That‚Äôs still ~40 people.

elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 09:14:09 +0000 2018	465	17	@Santiago7K @xJawz @joerogan Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 09:08:23 +0000 2018	596	36	@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 08:31:50 +0000 2018	334	11	@PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly
elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 08:29:13 +0000 2018	395	15	@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.
elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 08:17:41 +0000 2018	1868	36	@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.
elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 08:16:17 +0000 2018	577	44	@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is.
elonmusk	Wed Jun 20 08:05:47 +0000 2018	4415	234	@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 17:49:38 +0000 2018	381	25	@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate.
elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 17:46:50 +0000 2018	267	5	@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 17:44:19 +0000 2018	397	17	@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).

elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 17:31:00 +0000 2018	505	18	@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 17:16:19 +0000 2018	594	36	@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 17:00:07 +0000 2018	482	33	@TheSithSeth @doctorow I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too.
elonmusk	Sun Jun 17 16:55:05 +0000 2018	511	31	@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.

elonmusk	Sun Jun 10 20:00:37 +0000 2018	990	70	@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane.

elonmusk	Sun Jun 10 12:27:56 +0000 2018	17931	1166	@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another.
elonmusk	Sun Jun 10 12:16:50 +0000 2018	3458	210	@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle.

elonmusk	Sun Jun 10 12:10:09 +0000 2018	5523	441	@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.

Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
elonmusk	Mon May 14 19:00:17 +0000 2018	22891	2471	@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.

elonmusk	Sat May 05 00:09:58 +0000 2018	12167	1145	Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you‚Äôre short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/A0Q90pSLKA
elonmusk	Fri May 04 21:08:58 +0000 2018	12988	440	@TobyTurner New Roadster will have that
elonmusk	Fri May 04 13:13:14 +0000 2018	2689	59	@InvestorsLive Yes, definitely not
elonmusk	Fri May 04 13:10:49 +0000 2018	1818	80	@FredericLambert It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 13:02:16 +0000 2018	45355	3157	Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 12:43:59 +0000 2018	527	19	@mr_calico @FredericLambert Yup
elonmusk	Fri May 04 12:34:04 +0000 2018	906	63	@GlobalProTrader @wmiddelkoop True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 12:21:20 +0000 2018	1701	134	@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 12:04:51 +0000 2018	18182	1805	Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 11:55:43 +0000 2018	10912	652	The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter
elonmusk	Fri May 04 11:35:25 +0000 2018	9642	686	The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
elonmusk	Fri May 04 11:18:26 +0000 2018	4706	95	@MarekCyzio Exactly
elonmusk	Fri May 04 11:17:34 +0000 2018	10813	995	First, it‚Äôs important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while https://t.co/srEp1tf6ZU
elonmusk	Fri May 04 11:12:07 +0000 2018	38892	4110	Please ignore this thread unless you‚Äôre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
elonmusk	Fri May 04 10:44:51 +0000 2018	582	27	@Ataraxia_Invest @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 09:53:18 +0000 2018	807	62	@ThePhoenixFlare @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
elonmusk	Fri May 04 09:38:19 +0000 2018	10314	639	@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I‚Äôm a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
elonmusk	Fri May 04 09:20:24 +0000 2018	6000	368	@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The ‚Äúdry‚Äù questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.
